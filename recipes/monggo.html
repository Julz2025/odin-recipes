        <h2>Sauteed mung beans</h2>

        <p>
            Another dish I learned to cook and love whilst at university, which has since continued to be mine and my partner's comfort food.

                <li>Mung beans</li>

                <li>Add the mung beans to the pan and let it simmer with the aromatics. Season with salt, pepper and fish sauce.</li>
                <li>Add some more water if you prefer the dish to be saucier.</li>
                <li>Crumble the vegetable cube and let it come to a gentle boil.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the sliced cooked smoked mackerel and add the spinach leaves. </li>
