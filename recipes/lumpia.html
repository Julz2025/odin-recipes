        <h2>Deep fried meat and vegetable spring rolls</h2>

        <p>

            I first learned how to make lumpia for a cultural event at university showcasing Filipino cuisine. This is the version I like to make for myself and loved ones. I have to say this is a hit at parties!

        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>40x spring roll wrappers</li>
                <li>Meat and veg filling (see below)</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>sweet chilli sauce or any other dipping sauce of your choice</li>
                <P><em>Meat and veg mixture:</em></P>
                <li>500g beef and pork mince</li>
                <li>1x large brown onion finely diced</li>
                <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>3x medium sized carrots finely grated</li>
                <li>4x spring onion finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1/t tsp five spice powder</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1x large egg</li>
                
                
            </ul>



        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix mince meat, diced onion, grated carrots, chopped spring onion in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Crack one egg into the bowl and mix thoroughly. This will help bind the ingredients together.</li>
                <li>Add the condiments listed above to the meat and veg mixture: garlic powder, soy sauce, oyster sauce, five spice powder, salt and pepper. Combine thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Separate the spring roll wrappers. Place in lightly damp dish cloth to prevent the wrappers from drying out. While doing this step, the filling mixture will have time to marinade.</li>
                <li>Before filling the rolls, <strong>make sure you do a test taste first!</strong> Heat a small pan and add some oil. Once heated, scoop a tiny amount of the meat mixture and fry until brown. Check that you are happy with the seasoning and adjust accordingly.</li>
                <li>Scoop 1 tbsp of the meat and veg mixture and spread onto a wrapper.</li>
                <li>Fold the wrapper and form into a roll. Watch this tutorial.</li>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil. To test if the oil is hot enough, grab a chopstick and stick in the middle of the pan. If it bubbles, the oil is ready.</li>
                <li>Fry the lumpia rolls until golden. Do not over crowd the pan.</li>
                <li>Once it is no longer boiling hot, dip the lumpia in sweet chilli sauce and enjoy!</li>
